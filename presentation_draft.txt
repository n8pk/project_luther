Goal:

in Denver, look for a relationship between house prices and distance to nearest marijuana dispensary


Methodology:

collection-
    current house listings scraped from Redfin
    dispensary addresses scraped from coloradopotguide
    coordinates from google maps

cleaning-
    started with:
        address, house price, bedrooms, bathrooms, sqft of house, sqft of lot,
        year built, type of garage, number of nearby bus lines,
        distance to nearest dispensary, average price of nearest 5, 10, 15, 20 houses
    modeled: 
        house price based on distance to nearest dispensary, avg nearest 5
    transforming:
        log transformed hp, dist, avg because all started heavily right skewed
    outliers:
        still a few datapoints far out, removed anything more than 3 sd from the mean
